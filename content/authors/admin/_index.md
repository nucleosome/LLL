I am an undergraduate student at the Fuzhou Universtiy. My research interests include Communication Theory and Wireless Networks.

What fascinates me most to study wireless communications is that I can apply mathematical tools and fundamental communication concepts of telecommunications to solving new problems and helping people live in a more fully connected world.
